## muggle.dev or darkmuggle.org?

In a prior life I used the moniker `utlemming`. As a high school student
I noticed a tendency of those in my former sub-culture to make a run for the
state of Utah with a sort of lemming-like zeal.

When, unfortunately, I found myself going to Utah for school, I took the web
moniker of `utlemming` as a mild protest to my lemmingish behavior; I had become
an Utah Lemming.

Years later I discovered Harry Potter and it was a book series that I became
both fond of, and a bit obsessed with. When I joined Red Hat, I realized
that `utlemming` had the baggage of a prior life and a prior professional
identity (GPG keys, source repos, and such). I decided that switching
from `utlemming` to something more fun was in order, so I became a `darkmuggle.`

In the Harry Potter series a Muggle is a non-magical person. Such aimless souls
do not see the magical sub-world. Since programming is a bit of "magical", and there
is much in the programming field I will never know, I'm a Muggle practicing dark
magic.

For a while I have wanted acquire a 'Muggle' bit of real estate on the dark webs,
but all the cool domain names of {org,com,net,etc} were long since leased.
On a lark I checked and found `muggle.dev` available.
