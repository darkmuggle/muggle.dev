## muggle.dev or darkmuggle.org?

In a prior life I used the moniker `utlemming`. As a high school student I noticed a tendency of those in my former sub-culture to make a run the state of Utah with a sort of lemming-like zeal. When, unfortantely, I found myself going to Utah I took the web moniker of `utlemming` as a mild protest to my lemmingish; I was an Utah Lemming. For years, I used `utlemming` as my internet identification.

Years later I discovered Harry Potter and it was a book series that I became both fond of, and a bit obsessed with. When I joined Red Hat, I realized that `utlemming` had the baggage of a prior life and a prior professional identity (GPG keys, source repos, and such) so I decided that I would become `darkmuggle.`

For a while I have wanted acquire a 'Muggle' bit of real estate on the dark webs, but all the cool domain names of {org,com,net,etc} were long since leased. On a lark I checked and found '.dev' available.
